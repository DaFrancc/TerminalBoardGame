This is a very WIP crate that will allow users to make their own board games.
Should allow for use with dice, cards, and other types of game pieces.
Should work with games where player turn order is strict with no interruptions in turn order.
I will work on making it so that it will work with inconsistent player turn order for more
options for dynamic and interesting gameplay like jumps in UNO or any sort of interruptions
of the current player by other players. This crate is being made with the liars_dice project
in mind first and foremost, once that has been completed, this project will shift towards having
more gameplay options.
